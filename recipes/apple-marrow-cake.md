# Apple and marrow cake

A random recipe I've just come up with to use up excess apples and a
marrow. Mostly based on this [marrow and pecan cake recipe][1] and another
[courgette and apple recipe][2].

This recipe makes two cakes, I'll add the dimensions of the tins and work out
the quantities for one normal-sized cake later.

## Ingredients

* 500g self-raising flour
* 1tsp baking powder
* 3tsp mixed spice
* 2tsp ground cinnamon
* pinch salt
* ~100g dessicated coconut (I just put this in because I had it lying around)
* 200g dark muscovado sugar
* 100g light muscovado sugar
* 100g golen granulated sugar (don't think this sugar mix is important)
* 1 marrow (fairly small)
* 3 apples (eating - don't know what variety mine were)
* 6 eggs
* 400 ml sunflower oil
* 1 lemon
* 2tbsp mango and papaya yoghurt (any yoghurt probably fine)
* 200g raisins and/or sultanas

Note: It's not important to measure everything out before you start this recipe.

## Method

* Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Grease and line the tins.

* Remove the skin from the marrow, cut it in half and scoop the seeds out,
  keeping as much of the non-seedy flesh in tact as possible. Remove the cores
  from the apples. Grate them all into a collander and squeeze out some of the
  liquid. Leave to drain while preparing the other stuff.

* Sift the flour, baking powder, spices and salt into a big bowl. Then add the
  sugars, breaking up and big clumps with your fingers. Put in the coconut and
  stir everything up.

* In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, add the zest of the lemon and half of its
  juice. Add the oil. Mix in the grated apple and marrow. Put in the yoghurt and
  the raisins/sultanas.

* Tip the bowl of wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix. Then pour
  into the tins.

* Bake for about 1h -- 1h20, until a skewer come out clean. Remove and leave in
  the tin for half an hour before removing to a wire rack.
